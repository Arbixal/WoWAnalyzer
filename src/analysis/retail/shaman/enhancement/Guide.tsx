          The analysis in this guide is provided by <Contributor {...Seriousnes} /> in collaboration
          with the members and staff of the <a href="https://discord.gg/earthshrine">Earthshrine</a>{' '}
          Shaman discord. When reviewing this information, keep in mind that WoWAnalyzer is limited
          to the information that is present in your combat log. As a result, we have no way of
          knowing if you were intentionally doing something suboptimal because the fight or strat
          required it (such as Forced Downtime or holding cooldowns for a burn phase). Because of
          this, we recommend comparing your analysis against a top 100 log for the same boss.
